# Preface {-}

This is the first draft of the book `Data Science for Petroleum Production Engineering`. It presents a collection of algorithms, datasets, solutions on practical challenges in the uptream side of the production cycle of oil and gas.

We use modern tools; data science tools such as Python and R to help us gain a quick understanding of the production data.
